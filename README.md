# CarInsuranceBool

The CarInsuranceBool project is a basic approval program for car insurance. It prompts the applicant with a series of questions and uses boolean logic to determine whether or not the applicant qualifies for car insurance based on specific qualification rules.

# Project Description
The CarInsuranceBool project focuses on boolean logic to determine if an applicant meets the necessary criteria for car insurance. By asking questions related to age, DUI history, and speeding tickets, the program evaluates whether the applicant qualifies or not.

# Instructions
Upon running the program, the user will be asked a series of questions:

"What is your age?" (Integer)

"Have you ever had a DUI?" (Boolean - true/false)

"How many speeding tickets do you have?" (Integer)

After collecting the necessary information, the program will evaluate the applicant's qualification based on the following rules:

Applicants must be over 15 years old.

Applicants must not have any DUI's.

Applicants must not have more than 3 speeding tickets.

The program will then print the result of the boolean expression created from the above business rules, indicating whether the applicant is qualified or not.

# Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following skills and concepts related to boolean logic in C#:

Console application development

User input validation and data type handling (integer and boolean values)

Evaluation of boolean expressions using logical operators (greater than, equal to, not equal to)

Decision-making based on the outcome of boolean expressions

String manipulation and output formatting
